# <Prework study guide Webpage>

## Description

 My Motivation for creating this webpage is to have a simple way of studying HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. I built a simple webpage to house notes that were taken throughout the prework that I can go back and refer or add to. It solves the problem of not having the proper notes and information readily available at all times. I have learned much about the structure and art behind building/creating a webpage and using outside resources to develop an understanding of what I am using to create this webpage.
